# Unity.Package.HiringTest
Test used for potential hiring candidates

## Dependencies:
-Unity 2019.4.16f1
-Universal Render Pipeline
-TextMesh Pro

## Description:
### You will utilize this Unity package by importing it into the correct version of Unity. 
### Once you have brought in the package, look inside the package, in the Editor Folder, and apply all avaialable settings.


## Problems to Solve:
### The car’s materials are not applied correctly. Fix this first by updating the Graphics Settings.
### There are errors in your console without pushing Play. Find why these errors are happening and remove the 1 line of code in their respective scripts causing the errors.
### The car's movement visually 'stutters' or is inconsistent across the track when you press Play in the Editor. There is an error related to this problem. Remove the cause of the ‘stuttering’ car so that it smoothly moves on the bezier path.
### The car’s speed is not consistent. Find the root of the problem and have the car’s speed remain at a constant speed of 10. If you find unnecessary code, explain as you go why the code was unnecessary and what it was doing to cause the speed issue.
### The lap count is incorrect. See the method for counting laps and amend/update as necessary so that the lap count starts at 0, and only increments by 1 as it makes a full loop around the track.
