## 6 Problems to Solve:
### 1. The car’s materials are not applied correctly. Fix this first by updating the Graphics Settings.
### 2. There is a bug in the code related to errors in your console without pushing the Play button in Unity. Find why these errors are happening and remove the 1 line of code in their respective scripts causing these repetitive errors.
### 3. There is a JSON producing information about the car as text in the scene. However, the JSON is broken. Fix the parts of the JSON file to make sure the ‘Car Info’ text is changing and showing off each piece of information about the car.
### 4. The car's movement visually 'stutters' or is inconsistent across the track when you press Play in the Editor (Test this and see the visual problem). There is an error in the console related to this problem. Remove the cause of the ‘stuttering’ car so that it smoothly moves on the bezier path.
### 5. The car’s speed is not consistent. Find the root of the problem and remove the problem. Then have the car’s speed hard coded to remain at a constant speed of 10. If you find unnecessary code, explain as you go why the code was unnecessary and what it was doing to cause the speed issue.
### 6. The lap count is incorrect. See the method for counting laps and amend/update as necessary so that the lap count starts at 0, and only increments by 1 as it makes a full loop around the track. You may update the current solution or find your own method for counting laps using any Unity Tools or solutions you find online.
