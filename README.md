####    3. Unity Answers
####    4. GitHub
####    5. Stack Exchange
####    6. Google
####    7. If you get stuck on a Unity Editor related issue (not a code related issue) you may ask the SV team for assistance AFTER you have tried to solve the issue by using the above tools.
####    8. This Repo! There might be some hints if you look at git and how it validates scripts.

## Description:
#### To complete this you must screenshare your work AT ALL TIMES during the test. If you have to search the Internet for part of the solution, you must have your screen share show us your process. There will be no exceptions, and if you are working and not sharing your screen we will ask you to stop and share before you proceed further.
#### You will utilize this Unity package by first cloning from this repo. Your time will begin after you clone and you will have 30 min to 1 hour to complete teh below problems.
#### Next Import the package into the correct version of Unity that you have already downloaded. 
#### Once you have Imported the package into Unity, look inside the package, in the Editor Folder, find the Settings, and apply all avaialable settings.
#### Once you are inside Unity and have applied all available settings, find the Unity Scene labeled: Follow Path. Open this scene then solve the below Problems:

## 3 Problems to Solve:
### 1. There is a JSON producing information about the car as text in the scene. However, the JSON is broken. Fix the parts of the JSON file to make sure the ‘Car Info’ text is changing and showing off each piece of information about the car.
### 2. The car's movement visually 'stutters' or is inconsistent across the track when you press Play in the Editor (Test this and see the visual problem). There is an error in the console related to this problem. Remove the cause of the ‘stuttering’ car so that it smoothly moves on the bezier path.
### 3. The lap count is incorrect. See the method for counting laps and amend/update as necessary so that the lap count starts at 0, and only increments by 1 as it makes a full loop around the track. You may update the current solution or find your own method for counting laps using any Unity Tools or solutions you find online. <b>Hint</b> - this problem is extremely hard to solve if you have not solved for problem #2.
